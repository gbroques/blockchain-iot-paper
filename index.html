      <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
      <p>
          Traditional centralized approaches to IoT suffer from inherent weaknesses
          like single points of failure and high costs. We examine blockchains as a
          possible, more decentralized solution. We discuss five main challenges IoT
          faces with traditional approaches and how the blockchain circumvents these.
          After that we provide a broad overview of what the blockchain is, how it
          works, and introduce Ethereum&#8212;a blockchain platform for building
          decentralized applications. We then give three examples demonstrating the
          combination of blockchain and IoT. Next we examine two key blockchain
          challenges and how Ethereum plans to overcome them. We conclude blockchain
          is a promising technology for IoT, but needs further development to be a
          practical solution.

      <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>
          Business Insider projects the number of IoT devices will more than triple
          over the next five years [<a data-scroll href="#Newman17">Newman17</a>]. The Internet of Things (IoT) will
          impact lives to an ever-greater degree as more and more devices gain
          connectivity. From people&#8217;s homes, cars, hospitals, and even
          bodies&#8212;IoT creates endless possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
          Fulfilling this vision demands overcoming many challenges. These challenges
          stem from the centralized nature of traditional client-server models. IoT
          needs a more decentralized approach, namely the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
          In 2008 a mysterious whitepaper titled &#8220;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer
          Electronic Cash System&#8221; emerges on the Internet. The anonymous author
          introduces the blockchain, a public ledger, to solve the double spending
          problem. For the first time in history, electronic payments were possible
          without a trusted intermediary.
      </p>
      <p>
          Years later in 2014, Vitalik Buterin proposes a new platform called
          Ethereum. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum utilizes a blockchain and has
          cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum features a Turing-complete
          programming language. This makes Ethereum versatile and capable of
          applications beyond the scope of money. Versatility, among other properties
          we explore later, make Ethereum a promising solution for IoT.
      </p>
      <p>
          The success of Bitcoin&#8217;s underlying blockchain technology has
          generated much interest over the years. Not only from the public, but from
          industry leaders like IBM, Samsung, and Microsoft. Figure 1 displays
          interest in blockchain over the last five years and evidences this growing
          trend.

          But why the hype? What makes blockchain so interesting? This paper aims to
          explore these questions in the following sections. Section II discusses the
          challenges stemming from centralization and makes the case for the
          blockchain. Section III describes what the blockchain is, how it works, and
          the Ethereum platform. Section IV discusses three blockchain applications
          relating to IoT. Section V examines the challenges blockchains face, and
          how Ethereum plans to overcome them. Finally, we conclude in Section VI.

    <!-- SECTION II -->
    <section id="problem-with-centralization">
      <h2>II. THE PROBLEM WITH CENTRALIZATION</h2>
      <p>
          The client-server model reigns supreme among application architectures
          today. Therefore, many IoT applications use this existing paradigm. In a
          client-server model, multiple clients talk to one centralized server. This
          develops mega-monopolies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. In addition to
          creating monopolies, central servers create single points of failure, and
          easy targets for censorship. The blockchain circumvents these issues with
          decentralized Peer-to-Peer networking. In a Peer-to-Peer network, computers
          connect directly and share resources. No need for a central server.
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to the problems stated above, we can identify five main
          challenges relating specifically to IoT:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>High costs</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Privacy</li>
        <li>Interoperability</li>
        <li>Heavy Network Traffic</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          Each of these challenges stem from centralization, and could be solved by
          either Peer-to-Peer networks or blockchains.
      </p>

      <h3>High Costs</h3>
      <p>
          Typical infrastructure handling IoT today requires expensive networking
          equipment and vast server farms. An ever-increasing number of devices from
          6.6 billion in 2016 to 22.5 billion in 2021 leads to an unsustainable model
          [<a data-scroll href="#Newman17">Newman17</a>]. Infrastructure to analyze, process, and store massive amounts
          of data further increase costs.
      </p>
      <p>
          Maintenance costs are also high. Think about software updates. Devices like
          LED light bulbs and cars can last for years if not decades. Many companies
          fail to meet revenue targets and must continue providing software updates
          for fear of losing their user base [<a data-scroll href="#Brody14">Brody14</a>]. Either companies pay the
          price of maintaining server infrastructure for updates, or devices become
          obsolete. Both situations are not ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
          In contrast, decentralized networks and blockchains offer very low costs.
          Instead of paying for a central point, peers in the network provide the
          necessary computation, networking, and storage resources. Providing
          software updates only requires broadcasting the update to neighboring
          peers, which in turn broadcast to their neighboring peers, and so on, until
          the update propagates across the network.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
          In addition to high costs, centralized networks struggle with security.
          Many IoT applications rely on one centralized cloud server containing a
          list of every registered device. Companies must protect against
          man-in-the-middle attacks and device spoofing. Hackers intercept
          information sent between a device and server with man-in-the-middle
          attacks. Then they use that information to impersonate a device and gain
          entrance to a network.
      </p>
      <p>
          Every device in a network presents an opportunity for a hacker. Numerous
          examples in the media exist: from remote controlling jeeps, to changing a
          sniper&#8217;s target, and even altering a patient&#8217;s dose in a
          hospital [<a data-scroll href="#Osborne15">Osborne15</a>][<a data-scroll href="#Greenberg15">Greenberg15</a>][<a data-scroll href="#Kovacs15">Kovacs15</a>]. IoT networks only remain as
          secure as the least secure device. In other words, a hacker only needs to
          find the weakest link.
      </p>
      <p>
          While decentralized networks also struggle with security, blockchains offer
          a unique solution through asymmetric cryptography and consensus algorithms.
          We discuss asymmetric cryptography and consensus algorithms more in Section
          III.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
          Privacy remains a big issue with centralized networks. Centralized cloud
          servers store massive amounts of data generated by devices. Hackers target
          these giant data stores to gain access to sensitive and private
          information. Privacy grows more concerning depending on the type of
          application. For example, applications relating to health care must abide
          by various laws and regulations like HIPPA to ensure privacy. Similarly,
          PCI compliance aims to secure applications dealing with payments and credit
          card information.
      </p>
      <p>
          Many people rightfully distrust &#8220;phone-home&#8221; techniques for
          software updates. Earlier in 2017, Vizio agreed to pay $2.2 million dollars
          to settle charges related to the collection of user data from smart TVs
          [<a data-scroll href="#Maheshwari17">Maheshwari17</a>]. Vizio gave no notice of the collection or tracking, and was
          selling the data to third parties. A decentralized approach would prevent
          this scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
          As stated earlier, the blockchain is a <em>public </em>ledger. Meaning data
          on the blockchain is available to anyone. Therefore, privacy remains a
          challenge for blockchains. However, solutions exist and will be discussed
          in Section V.
      </p>

      <h3>Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
          The IoT ecosystem hosts a slew of different manufacturers, operating
          systems, versions, and communication protocols. This fragmentation leads to
          poor interoperability between devices. Large companies must agree upon open
          standards to remedy this problem. Fear of losing their competitive
          advantage makes some hesitant to do so. On the contrary, public and open
          blockchains offer a common platform for devices and developers.
      </p>

      <h3>Heavy Network Traffic</h3>
      <p>
          More and more devices generating more and more data creates large amounts
          of traffic. Annual data generation for any given device will increase from
          145 zeta-bytes in 2015 to 600 zeta-bytes by 2020. [<a data-scroll href="#Cisco16">Cisco16</a>]. This growing
          traffic presents a problem for centralized cloud infrastructure on two
          fronts: (1) some applications require low end-to-end latency, and (2)
          centralized systems have a single point of failure.
      </p>
      <p>
          IoT applications requiring low end-to-end latency include augmented
          reality, speech recognition, computer vision, machine learning, and
          decision making. Creating a network capable of supporting these
          applications is critical.
      </p>
      <p>
          As previously mentioned, centralized networks have single points of
          failure. Single points of failure cause more concern as human life and
          health depend more upon IoT. Ensuring the robustness of critical devices
          like wireless enabled pacemakers will be paramount for IoT&#8217;s success
          [<a data-scroll href="#Booth16">Booth16</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
          In contrast, decentralized peer-to-peer networks and blockchains have no
          single point of failure. But heavy traffic strains a network regardless of
          architecture. How blockchains plan to deal with this will be discussed in
          Section V.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION III -->
    <section id="what-is-blockchain">
      <h2>III. WHAT IS THE BLOCKCHAIN?</h2>
      <p>
          The blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger first conceptualized by
          the inventor of Bitcoin to solve the double spending problem. A problem
          with digital cash where people can spend money multiple times. Companies
          like PayPal solve this problem by recording transactions in a centralized
          database. PayPal serves as a trusted intermediary, and its ledger a source
          of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
          Blockchain similarly enables the transfer of digital cash, but cuts out
          middle-men like PayPal. The blockchain stores all transactions, rather than
          a centralized database. The blockchain is <em>distributed</em>, meaning
          each member of the network stores a complete copy of it. But why is it
          called a blockchain?
      </p>
      <p>
          Think of the blockchain as a log of records, where records are batched into
          timestamped blocks. A unique hash identifies each block, and each block
          references the hash of the previous block. This establishes a <em>chain of blocks</em>, 
          or blockchain [<a data-scroll href="#Christidis16">Christidis16</a>]. Now we know where the name comes from, but what is a block?
      </p>

      <div class="frame">
        <p class="caption">
          <strong class="caption-label">Figure 2:</strong>
          The two parts of a block
        </p>
        <img src="block.svg" alt="The two parts of a block">
        <p class="caption">
          <strong class="caption-label">Adapted from:</strong>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGTzuDG5jEA&t=547s">
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGTzuDG5jEA&t=547s
          </a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
          Figure 2 illustrates the two parts of a block: (1) the header and (2) the
          body. The block header contains important meta information like a timestamp
          when the block was created, the hash of the previous block, and a hash of
          all the transactions. Hashing this information together creates a unique
          identifier for the block. The body of the block simply consists of raw
          transaction data. The exact contents of a block depend upon implementation,
          but those are the core components. We stated earlier blockchains are
          immutable. Meaning they cannot change and are tamper-proof. Understanding
          how blockchains store transactions illuminates their tamper-proof nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each block stores transactions in a data structure known as a
        <strong>Merkle tree</strong>. Hashes of each transaction make up the leaf
        nodes of the tree. Hashing the concatenation of these hashes creates the
        next level of the tree. This hashing process continues upward eventually
        forming a <em>root hash</em>. The <strong>root hash </strong>acts a
        &#8220;digital fingerpint&#8221; allowing nodes to quickly verify
        transactions and detect tampering. In other words, every non-leaf node
        contains the hash of its children. If someone were to add, delete, or
        modify a transaction, the root hash would change. Figure 3 illustrates the
        simplest Merkle tree, a binary Merkle tree.

          </a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>How does the blockchain work?</h3>
      <p>
        To better understand how blockchains work, we must first understand more
        about <em>asymmetric cryptography</em>. Asymmetric cryptography, also known
        as public key encryption, uses pairs of public and private keys to encrypt
        and decrypt data [<a data-scroll href="#Rouse16">Rouse16</a>]. A public key addresses each member of the
        network, and members sign all transactions with a corresponding private
        key. Once signed, members broadcast transactions to neighboring peers in
        the network. Peers ensure the validity of transactions before further
        broadcast, discarding any invalid transactions. A transaction propagates
        across the network until all nodes validate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a certain time, a node in the network packs up valid transactions into a
        timestamped block. This node then broadcasts the block back to the network.
        If valid, peers add the block to their chain. This process repeats for all
        transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The node which creates the block depends upon the <em>consensus algorithm</em>. 
        The consensus algorithm determines how the
        network agrees upon the state of the world and settles disputes. Bitcoin
        uses a consensus algorithm known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Creating blocks
        through PoW is called <em>mining</em>. Mining involves a node solving a
        computationally expensive puzzle. The miner who solves the puzzle first
        creates the block and receives a reward of Bitcoins. Mining keeps the
        network secure.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ethereum also uses PoW, but will eventually switch to a less computationally expensive algorithm 
          called Proof-of-Stake (PoS) [<a data-scroll href="#Zamfir15">Zamfir15</a>][<a data-scroll href="#CryptoCompare17">CryptoCompare17</a>]. Creating blocks through PoS 
          might be called <em>virtual mining</em> [<a data-scroll href="#GitHub17a">GitHub17a</a>]. For more information about PoS, see 
          Buterin &#8220;On Stake&#8221; [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin14a">Buterin14a</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to PoW and PoS, many other &#8220;proof-of-XXX&#8221;
          algorithms exist. Tschorsch and Scheuermann provide a good overview in
          &#8220;Bitcoin and Beyond: A Technical Survey on Decentralized Digital
          Currencies&#8221; [<a data-scroll href="#Tschorsch16">Tschorsch16</a>]. Like many consensus algorithms exist, many
          blockchains exist with varying attributes.
      </p>

      <h3>Public, Private, and Consortium Blockchains</h3>
      <p>
          Three taxonomies help in classifying blockchains: public, private, and
          consortium. The difference between these taxonomies lies within the answers
          to the following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who has read access?</li>
        <li>Who has write access?</li>
        <li>Who verifies transactions?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          We will begin our discussion with public blockchains, as they first came
          into existence.
      </p>

      <h4>Public Blockchains</h4>
      <p>
          Public blockchains allow anyone to read, write, and verify transactions.
          Every node verifying each transaction keeps public-chains extremely secure,
          but at the cost of speed. No single entity owns or controls public
          blockchains. The public provides all the infrastructure; therefore, costs
          remain low. We can consider public blockchains fully decentralized, thus
          benefit from network effects.
      </p>

      <h4>Private Blockchains</h4>
      <p>
          Private blockchains restrict write permissions to one entity. Private
          blockchains may restrict read permissions to a varying degree depending
          upon the application. The ability to restrict read permissions grants more
          privacy than public blockchains. One entity owns and controls the
          blockchain, thus rules and transactions can easily change when desired.
          Costs depend upon implementation and tend to be higher than pubic
          counterparts. Only a few nodes verify each transaction, making transactions
          cheaper and faster compared to public blockchains. We can consider private
          blockchains fully centralized, thus not able to benefit from network
          effects.
      </p>

      <h4>Consortium Blockchains</h4>
      <p>
          Consortium blockchains are like a hybrid between public and private
          blockchains. Like private blockchains, read permissions may be public or
          restricted to a varying degree. Write permissions are restricted, but may
          be open to a subset of the public. A pre-determined group of nodes verify
          transactions [<a data-scroll href="#Thompson16">Thompson16</a>]. Rather than one entity or the public, consortium
          blockchains operate under the control and guidance of a group. Consortium
          blockchains offer the same speed and privacy of private blockchains. We can
          consider consortium blockchains partially decentralized.
      </p>
      <p>
          This paper focuses on public over private and consortium blockchains
          because of network effects like greater interoperability and lower costs
          [<a data-scroll href="#Jentzsch17">Jentzsch17</a>]. Anyone can create an application on public blockchains with
          permissions built in from the start. This means anyone can interface,
          integrate, and build on top of pre-existing applications. In addition to
          greater interoperability, public blockchains also provide lower costs. One
          can deploy their application to the &#8220;blockchain cloud&#8221; where
          other public members provide the necessary computation, storage, and
          networking resources. Countless public blockchain implementations exist,
          but this paper focuses on Ethereum.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethereum, Smart Contracts, and Dapps</h3>
      <p>
          Ethereum grew out of Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s frustration with using Bitcoin
          for &#8220;more than just money&#8221; [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin14b">Buterin14b</a>]. Buterin worked closely
          with several projects, each suffering from the same problem&#8212;a
          fragmented ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ethereum is Buterin&#8217;s attempt to create a common platform for those
          projects to build on. Ethereum shares many features with Bitcoin, with one
          key difference. Ethereum features a Turing complete programming language.
          Turing-complete meaning programmers can compute anything that is
          computable. These programs are called <em>smart-contracts</em>.
          Smart-contracts live on the blockchain and govern the rules of interaction
          and exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ethereum offers three programming languages to create smart-contracts with [<a data-scroll href="#EthDocs17">EthDocs17</a>]:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Solidity which is like JavaScript</li>
        <li>Serpent which is like Python</li>
        <li>And LLL (Lisp Like Language) which is a low-level language like Assembly</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          Offering familiar languages reduces the learning curve for new developers.
          Applications written with smart-contracts are called decentralized
          applications, or <strong>Dapps</strong>. Smart-contracts make up the
          &#8220;backend&#8221; logic of a Dapp. For the &#8220;frontend&#8221;, a
          developer uses standard technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Traditional web apps require server side code, whereas Dapps require
          smart-contract code. To browse and interact with Dapps, people download a
          special browser called <em>Mist</em>. Soon browser extensions will allow
          people to access Dapps in standard browsers like Chrome and FireFox
          [<a data-scroll href="#MetaMask17">MetaMask17</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
          In addition to smart-contracts, Ethereum introduces two more technologies:
          Swarm for decentralized storage and Whisper for decentralized messaging
          [<a data-scroll href="#Gerring14">Gerring14</a>]. Swarm allows for storage of static assets like frontend code,
          images, and video. While Whisper lets Dapps communicate with each other.
          Together these three technologies fulfill Ethereum&#8217;s vision as a
          &#8220;world computer&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
          IBM states &#8220;to perform the functions of traditional IoT solutions
          without a centralized broker, any decentralized approach must support three
          foundational functions:&#8221; [<a data-scroll href="#Pureswaran15">Pureswaran15</a>]
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Peer-to-Peer messaging (Whisper)</li>
        <li>Distributed file sharing (Swarm)</li>
        <li>Autonomous device coordination (Smart-contracts)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
          Ethereum supports each foundational function making a wide variety of IoT
          applications possible.

      <h2>IV. APPLICATIONS TO IOT</h2>
      <p>
          We now shift our focus to three IoT applications utilizing the Ethereum
          blockchain. The first two applications, a semi-autonomous washing machine,
          and smart-locks or &#8220;slocks,&#8221; have real world implementations.
          The third example, supply chains, serves to exemplify the potential of
          blockchains.
      </p>

      <h3>Semi-Autonomous Washing Machine</h3>
      <p>
          IBM states as IoT scales decentralized networks have the potential to
          reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs removing single points of
          failure that could exist in traditional centralized networks
          [<a data-scroll href="#Pureswaran15">Pureswaran15</a>]. As a proof-of-concept,
          IBM and Samsung created a <em>semi-autonomous</em> washing machine. The washing machine could
          download its own software updates, order detergent when it was low, order
          servicing and replacement parts, and negotiate energy usage among
          neighboring devices. All while keeping the owner informed by broadcasting
          to his or her mobile device. This application demonstrates the power of
          automation through secure machine-to-machine payments.
      </p>
      <h3>Slock.it</h3>
      <p>
          Slock.it introduces another interesting blockchain application for IoT with
          the idea of smart-locks. Many people today have a lot of property that goes
          unused most of the time. Some of these items includes cars, bikes, washing
          machines, and houses. Slock.it allows people to easily sell, rent, and
          share their property, turning underutilized property into revenue
          generating assets [<a data-scroll href="#Jentzsch15">Jentzsch15</a>]. Services like Airbnb already allow people
          to rent out their house, but for smaller things like renting out a bike,
          many people may not bother with the hassle. With Slock.it you can lock your
          bike in a public area with a &#8220;slock&#8221; or <em>smart-lock</em>.
          When someone wants to rent it out they pay a deposit, then get their
          deposit back, minus the cost to rent, when they&#8217;re done using it. A
          <em>smart-contract</em> defines both the deposit and cost to rent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slock.it demonstrates the power of the blockchain to unlock the 
        <em>sharing economy</em>.An economy characterized by people owning less,
        and sharing more. With a finite resource planet, sharing will become more
        important over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Supply Chains</h3>
      <p>
          Blockchains also have the power to revolutionize our supply chains. IBM
          illustrates this example in an interactive web demo [<a data-scroll href="#IBM17">IBM17</a>]. Imagine
          shipping frozen cherries to a grocery store. To start each carrier in the
          supply chain agrees to a smart-contract that if the frozen cherries exceed
          32&#176; F, then the carrier will be held responsible for any losses.
      </p>
      <p>
          First, a factory packages the frozen cherries equipped with a temperature
          sensor. The temperature sensor stores data locally, transmitting data to
          the blockchain at each exchange. The factory then ships the frozen cherries
          across the ocean. The exchange and initial temperature is recorded in the
          blockchain. During shipment, the temperate remains below 32&#176;. The ship
          then arrives at land and transfers the frozen cherries to a truck. Again,
          the temperature and exchange is recorded in the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
          During shipment, the truck&#8217;s cooling equipment malfunctions and the
          temperature of the cherries exceeds 32&#176; F. This flags the grocery
          store to inspect the cherries upon arrival. The grocery store finds the
          cherries are ruined and charges the trucking company for all losses.
      </p>
      <p>
          Instead of having separate records, each member of the supply chain has a
          single source of truth, the blockchain. This makes handling disputes and
          determining provenance easy. Like the semi-autonomous washing machine, this
          process could be automated with machine-to-machine communication at each
          exchange. Easily determining provenance, or source of origin, brings
          transparency and trust to the marketplace. With a blockchain, a consumer
          can easily verify a product is organic, sustainably-harvested,
          hand-crafted, etc. [<a data-scroll href="#Baker15">Baker15</a>]. For these reasons, blockchains make sense for
          supply chains.

    <!-- SECTION V -->
    <section id="blockchain-challenges">
      <h2>V. BLOCKCHAIN CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>
          This section discusses the challenges systemic to all <em>public </em>
          blockchains. Private and consortium blockchains do not share these same
          challenges, and will not be discussed. We examine how Ethereum plans to
          overcome these challenges, as it is the major public blockchain player.
      </p>
      <p>
          For blockchain to become a viable solution for IoT it must overcome two
          main challenges: (1) scalability and (2) privacy. We can further divide
          scalability into two sub-challenges: processing power and storage. We begin
          our examination with processing power.
      </p>

      <h3>Processing Power</h3>
      <p>
          Mainstream centralized payment processors like Visa average 2,000
          transactions per second (tps) [<a data-scroll href="#Visa17">Visa17</a>]. Up to 56,000 tps during busy times
          [<a data-scroll href="#Visa15">Visa15</a>]. On the other hand, Bitcoin handles 7 tps while confirming
          transactions takes 10 minutes or more [<a data-scroll href="#Croman16">Croman16</a>]. Ethereum struggles with
          similar rates, but remains ambitious. With future releases of Ethereum,
          Vitalik Buterin aims to compete with Visa on nothing but consumer laptops
          [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin16a">Buterin16a</a>]. Examining two of Ethereum&#8217;s approaches to scalability
          illuminates Buterin&#8217;s bold claims. Two main ideas exist: <strong>sharding</strong> and <strong>state-channels</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>Sharding</h4>
      <p>
        Currently every node on the network must validate each transaction.
        <strong>Sharding</strong> proposes only a subset of nodes validate each
        transaction [<a data-scroll href="#GitHub17b">GitHub17b</a>]. Sharding works by dividing Ethereum&#8217;s
        blockchain state into <em>shards</em>. Each shard contains various
        accounts, applications, and transactions. Accounts and applications live in
        one shard, but can talk to other shards when necessary. The protocol then
        assigns a randomly selected subset of nodes to validate all the
        transactions for a given shard.
      </p>

      <h4>State Channels</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>State channels</strong>, or off-chain networks, increases processing power by moving
        <em>state-altering</em> interactions between two participants
        <em>off</em> the chain. Jeff Coleman describes how state-channels work in three basic steps [<a data-scroll href="#Coleman15">Coleman15</a>]:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lock part of the blockchain state</li>
        <li>Update the state amongst the participants themselves</li>
        <li>Submit the new state back to the blockchain</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          The idea behind state-channels comes from Bitcoin&#8217;s lightning
          network. A solution for &#8220;lightning-fast&#8221; payments on the
          Bitcoin network [<a data-scroll href="#LightningNetwork17">LightningNetwork17</a>]. The Raiden Network implements the
          same idea for Ethereum. As state-channels scale linearly with the number of
          participants, the Raiden Network claims to support up to 1,000,000 tps
          [<a data-scroll href="#RaidenNetwork17">RaidenNetwork17</a>]. In addition to increasing the number of transactions per
          second, state-channels also increase privacy because off-chain transactions
          are not recorded in the public ledger.
      </p>

      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>
          As blockchains scale, storage presents another big problem. Keep in mind,
          each full-node in the network must contain an entire copy of the
          blockchain. The blockchain grows quite large as it contains a record of all
          the transactions on the network. As of April 2017, the bitcoin blockchain
          requires 112 GB of storage space and grows by about 5 MB per hour
          [<a data-scroll href="#Blockchain17">Blockchain17</a>]. If Bitcoin were to process 2,000 tps, then the blockchain
          would grow by several tera-bytes per year. If the blockchain were to grow
          to a large number like 100 TB, then only large businesses would run
          full-nodes posing a centralization risk [<a data-scroll href="#GitHub17c">GitHub17c</a>]. Two possible solutions
          to reduce storage exist: <strong>state-tree pruning</strong> and 
          <strong>blockchain rent</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>State-Tree Pruning</h4>
      <p>
          To understand state-tree pruning, we first need to better understand
          how Ethereum stores data in the blockchain. Every block contains the
          &#8220;state root&#8221;. A hash of a special Merkle tree that stores the
          entire state of the system: all account balances, smart-contract code, etc
          [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin15">Buterin15</a>]. Blocks differ little between state changes.
          Therefore, to save space state trees use references to data that remains
          the same between state transitions.
      </p>

      <div class="frame">
        <p class="caption">
          <strong class="caption-label">Figure 4:</strong>
          A state transition between two blocks
        </p>
        <img src="blockchain-state-transition.svg" alt="A diagram demonstrating a state transition between two blocks">
        <p class="caption">
          <strong class="caption-label">Adapted from:</strong>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/26/state-tree-pruning/">
            https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/26/state-tree-pruning/
          </a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
          Figure 4 shows account 14&#8217;s balance increase from 49 to 71 between
          two blocks. Block 154&#8217;s state tree contains references to the
          previous state tree when unchanged. <strong>State tree pruning </strong>
          mandates a counter keeps track of the number of references to each node in
          the tree. When the number of references to a node reaches zero, we sentence
          the node to &#8220;death row&#8221;. If nothing references that node again
          within a certain number of blocks, we delete the node from the database.
          This way we only store nodes part of the current state and recent history,
          but not history older than a certain number of blocks. This approach
          resembles garbage collection in programming languages and tree-based
          version control systems like Git.
      </p>

      <h4>Blockchain Rent</h4>
      <p>
          Another approach to reducing storage is blockchain rent. Currently users
          pay a one-time blockchain storage fee, with a one-time refund for clearing
          that storage. <strong>Blockchain rent</strong> proposes to charge users for storage over
          time. When an account&#8217;s balance reaches zero and can no longer afford
          rent, the account is deleted. This solves the problem of
          &#8220;dust&#8221;. <em>Dust</em> is the accumulation of accounts with
          <strong>near zero</strong> balance not worth the transaction fee to send.
          Some estimate &#8220;dust&#8221; makes up most of the Bitcoin blockchain
          [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin14c">Buterin14c</a>]. While blockchain rent solves the problem of
          &#8220;dust,&#8221; some warn of possible dangers of deleting
          smart-contracts [Borah15].
      </p>
      <p>
          Like programs today, smart-contracts will depend on other smart-contracts
          in the form of &#8220;libraries&#8221; [<a data-scroll href="#SolidityDocs17">SolidityDocs17</a>]. For example, a
          smart-contract might rely on another smart-contract for some tiny utility
          function. Some of these dependency contracts may be forgotten about over
          time causing active smart-contracts to fail. Due to this concern, a concept
          of reviving deleted contracts was introduced [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin16b">Buterin16b</a>]. Suppose the
          transaction that deletes the smart-contract generates a receipt in that
          block. Then anyone could &#8220;resurrect&#8221; the contract by providing
          the necessary data and an appropriate fee [<a data-scroll href="#Buterin16b">Buterin16b</a>]. State-tree pruning
          and blockchain rent are only two ideas to reduce the size of the
          blockchain. Many more ideas exist as Ethereum Improvement Proposals on
          GitHub [<a data-scroll href="#GitHub17d">GitHub17d</a>].
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
          In addition to scalability, privacy is the other big issue with public
          blockchains. Every device signs each transaction with their public key,
          which exists in the open blockchain. One can analyze this data, identify
          patterns, and create connections between public keys to make informed
          inferences about their actual identities [<a data-scroll href="#Christidis16">Christidis16</a>]. Two solutions are
          <strong>ring signatures </strong>and <strong>zk-SNARKs</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>Ring Signatures</h4>
      <p>
          Ring signatures grant users anonymity with respect to a group. The
          transaction, sender and recipient addresses remain public, but the group
          obscures the link between them. This gives users
          <em>plausible deniability</em>. Plausible deniability means no one can
          definitively link a user to a given address or transaction. To create a
          ring signature, a group of block chain users come together and each sign a
          &#8220;ring&#8221; with their public key. Ring signatures can only be
          &#8220;completed&#8221; or verified correct by some secret information,
          usually the user&#8217;s private key [<a data-scroll href="#Mercer16a">Mercer16a</a>]. The contract that
          &#8220;mixes&#8221; the users&#8217; public keys together and creates the
          ring signature can be called the <em>mixing contract</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also an upgraded version of a ring signature called a
        <strong>linkable ring signature</strong>. Linkable ring signatures have the
        additional property of allowing a blockchain user to create a tag that
        allows third parties to &#8220;complete&#8221; the ring. The tag
        <em>links</em> back to the original public key, but ensures the identity
        remains unknown with respect to the group public keys. Figure 5
        demonstrates a linkable ring signature in a mixing contract. Rebekah Mercer
        discusses ring signatures in greater detail in &#8220;Privacy on the
        Blockchain: Unique Ring Signatures&#8221; and at Nicolas Courtois&#8217;

      <h4>zk-SNARKs</h4>
      <p>
          A Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge or
          zk-SNARK, proves some fact without revealing any information. zk-SNARKs are
          succinct meaning the proof is short and quick to verify. For example, a
          zk-SNARK would allow a person to prove to a hospital they have appropriate
          medical coverage without revealing any insurance information. A protocol
          named Zcash uses zk-SNARKs to allow miners to verify encrypted
          transactions, without revealing the transaction amount, sender or recipient
          addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
          Zcash solves the problem of putting private data on public blockchains.
          While quick to verify, zk-SNARKs take several minutes to produce and are
          computationally expensive [<a data-scroll href="#Ben-Sasson15">Ben-Sasson15</a>]. Reducing this time requires more
          research.
      </p>
      <p>
          A final point about privacy is the blockchain is not meant for general data
          storage. This is the role of technologies like Swarm or IPFS [<a data-scroll href="#IPFS17">IPFS17</a>]. If
          data needs to be private, then combine the blockchain with existing
          solutions like encryption and private databases. For example, storing the
          address of an encrypted file on the blockchain ensures only select people
          could view the file&#8217;s contents. Alternatively, storing references to data in private databases is appropriate in sensitive
          contexts like health care.

      <h2>VI. CONCLUSION</h2>
      <p>
          IoT&#8217;s future success depends upon examining traditional approaches.
          The blockchain poses as a possible alternative by providing greater
          decentralization, lower costs, enhanced security, a common open-source
          platform, and robust network. While the blockchain was created for the
          purposes of Bitcoin, it is now being adapted for new and exciting platforms
          like Ethereum.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ethereum ambitiously plans to become a &#8220;world computer&#8221;
          creating a myriad of possibilities. These possibilities include
          applications for IoT like smart-locks, more autonomous machines, and
          enhanced supply chains. These applications have profound implications for
          the economy. Smart-locks will usher in the &#8220;sharing economy&#8221;.
          More autonomous machines will produce an &#8220;economy of things&#8221;.
          Supply chains will have greater transparency and less friction.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, the blockchain is still a young technology with many problems that
          need solving. Problems that seem surmountable. Ethereum is hard at work
          with promising, yet un-proven solutions. Industry interest will create more
          private and consortium blockchains, while Ethereum leads the way for public
          chains. Future IoT networks need greater decentralization and we&#8217;re
          only beginning to understand the blockchain&#8217;s capability. Only time
          will tell if blockchain is the answer.
